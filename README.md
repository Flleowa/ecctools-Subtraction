## Subtracting from the Public Key


# Available commands

-p We write our public key from which we will subtract. (For single subtraction)

-i We enter our text file, which contains our public keys. Each key must be written on a new line. (For multiple subtraction)

-n Specify a number how many times we are going to subtract from the public key.

-s Specify the number that we are going to subtract from the public key. This number will be subtracted as many times as you specify in the -n command.

-o Specify the name of the file where the results will be saved. If you do not specify, a file will be created with the name of the public key from which we subtract. If we subtract from several keys at once, a separate file will be created for each key and the results will be written there. If we specify which file to write to, the results for each key will be written in order in the file. There will be a line gap between different keys in the results. The recording order will be exactly the same as the order of the keys.
